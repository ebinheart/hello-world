# hello-world
My first Repository
Im an ambitious person with a drive to succeed in life. I am anxious to learn as much as I can about programming,
and implement my knowledge as well as I can in order to make the most of my newly developed skills.
I have already started teaching myself and now I am enrolled in classes towards a degree in Computer Science.
